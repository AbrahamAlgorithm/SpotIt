# SpotIt

SpotIt is a location-based search application that allows users to find nearby stores selling the products they desire. Built with Python (Flask) for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, SpotIt aims to bridge the gap between online product discovery and offline in-store purchases.

## Features

- **Product Search**: Users can search for specific products they're interested in, and SpotIt will provide a list of nearby stores that carry those items.
- **Location Services**: By leveraging the user's location or allowing manual entry, SpotIt can pinpoint their whereabouts and provide relevant search results within their vicinity.
- **Store Information**: In addition to product availability, SpotIt provides detailed information about the stores, including addresses, contact details, and operating hours.
- **Directions and Maps**: With integrated Google Maps functionality, users can easily navigate to the stores carrying their desired products.
- **User Accounts and Preferences**: Users can create accounts to save their favorite products, stores, and locations for future reference.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - **Frontend**: TensorFlow.js (for future image recognition capabilities)
  - **Backend**: To be determined (product search API, Google Places API)
- **Infrastructure**: Version control (Git), deployment platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS), development tools (VS Code, Ubuntu)

## Project Structure
